    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¾ cup warm water, or more as needed</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup.<br>
        Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic.<br> 
        Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl;<br>
             mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside.</li>
             <li> Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.</li>
             <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; <br>
                keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out. <br>
                Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. <br>
                Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle.<br>
                Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent.<br>
